00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:56,848
Somebody asked me:

2
00:00:57,099 --> 00:01:00,351
"Phil, if you could be anywhere,
where would you be?"

3
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:03,146
I said to him,
"Probably right here...

4
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:06,482
...Elko, Nevada."
Our nation's high at 79 today.

5
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,402
In California, they'll have
warm weather tomorrow...

6
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:12,280
...gang wars and some
overpriced real estate.

7
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:15,366
In the Pacific Northwest,
they'll have some...

8
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,285
...very, very tall trees.

9
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:20,079
Clear across the Rockies
and Great Plains.

10
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,749
But look out, here comes trouble.

11
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,960
Oh, boy!

12
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,337
Front coming our way!
Look out!

13
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:32,383
What will that mean to us?
One of these big, blue things!

14
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:36,512
